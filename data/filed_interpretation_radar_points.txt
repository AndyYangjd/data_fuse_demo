Below some of the fields are explained in more detail:

x is front, y is left

vx, vy are the velocities in m/s.

vx_comp, vy_comp are the velocities in m/s compensated by the ego motion.

We recommend using the compensated velocities.

invalid_state: state of Cluster validity state.

(Invalid states)

0x01	invalid due to low RCS

0x02	invalid due to near-field artefact

0x03	invalid far range cluster because not confirmed in near range

0x05	reserved

0x06	invalid cluster due to high mirror probability

0x07	Invalid cluster because outside sensor field of view

0x0d	reserved

0x0e	invalid cluster because it is a harmonics

(Valid states)

0x00	valid

0x04	valid cluster with low RCS

0x08	valid cluster with azimuth correction due to elevation

0x09	valid cluster with high child probability

0x0a	valid cluster with high probability of being a 50 deg artefact

0x0b	valid cluster but no local maximum

0x0c	valid cluster with high artefact probability

0x0f	valid cluster with above 95m in near range

0x10	valid cluster with high multi-target probability

0x11	valid cluster with suspicious angle

dynProp: Dynamic property of cluster to indicate if is moving or not.

0: moving

1: stationary

6: crossing moving

7: stopped

ambig_state: State of Doppler (radial velocity) ambiguity solution.

0: invalid

2: staggered ramp

3: unambiguous

4: stationary candidates

pdh0: False alarm probability of cluster (i.e. probability of being an artefact caused by multipath or similar).

0: invalid

1: <25%

2: 50%

3: 75%

4: 90%

5: 99%
